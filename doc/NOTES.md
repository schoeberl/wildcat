# Implementation Notes

Keep a log on resource needs and fmax

## Wildcat synth results:

Xilinx/AMD FPGA 100 MHz, ASIC 50 MHz constraint
FPGA with the register file as memory

ASIC size in report 13, openroad-floorplan.log at the end
ASIC for max tt 025C 1v80 in report 54, ws.max.rpt

make hw-fmax

make synth-fmax
make openlane


### 14 Sept 2024 (DATE submission) hash 01cc107dde

1744 LUTs, 1329 FFs - with overconstrained to 200 MHz, and FF reg file

with 100 MHz, reg file in memory

1214 LUTs, 303 FFs
Slack 0.120ns

probably as a register file as FFs
[INFO] Floorplanned on a die area of 0.0 0.0 434.645 445.365 (um).
max_tt_025C_1v80: 3.07

1273 LUTs, 305 FFs
Slack -0.162ns

with register file defined as memory:
[INFO] Floorplanned on a die area of 0.0 0.0 411.61 422.33 (um).
max_tt_025C_1v80: 4.86

with register file defined as FF:
[INFO] Floorplanned on a die area of 0.0 0.0 438.505 449.225 (um).
max_tt_025C_1v80: 2.55

Looks like the Verilog memory definition is more efficient than the register array.
Probably because of the priority mux definition of the generated Verilog code.

Better define the steps for fmax:
1. `make APP=asm/apps/blink.s hw-fmax`
1. `make synth-fmax` - synthesize with 100 MHz constraint
