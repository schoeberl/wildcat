# Collection of Notes

Some notes collected along exploring RISC-V.

## Pipeline Organizations

 * single cycle (= simulator, or tiny programs)
 * sequential (like processors from the last century)
 * 2 stages (load and store will stall)
 * 3 stages
 * EX and MEM can be in parallel
 * EX can include decode
 * 4 stages: standard without the WB
 * 5 stages: mostly useless WB (just a Mux)

## Reset

ASIC memories with an input register have a random address value in the first clock cycle.
Therefore, the first instruction shall not be executed.
The instruction memory (SPM or cache) shall assert stall on this initial cycle, and Wildcat will substitute the instruction with a NOP.
Stalling keeps the PC constant, therefore we can reset it to 0 (and not -4).

Caches on a miss assert stall as well.

## Notes, Ideas

 * LUI could be recoded as ADDI with R0
 * Branch predictor idea from Tommy: ```pc == bp_addr ? bp_target : pc + 4``` and setting those on any taken branch

## Module Organization

 * An instruction memory/cache can contain a counter for the PC with autoincrement
   - just reset it on a jump or branch (like IBEX)
   - Or keep it classic with a pc-next input

## ECALL

`ecall` is an instruction to call out to a supervisor or operating system:
environment call.
The meaning of parameters is on purpose not defined in the RISC-V ISA.

However, following uses have been observed:

* Current ISA tests use a0/x10 and ecall for pass/fail, including a failed test case number.
  - `li a0, 0; li a7, 93`
  - A value of 0 is pass, fail is the test number multiplied by 2 added 1.
  - failing test is also in gp/x3 (somtimes multiplied by 2 and 1 added)
  - Probably spike implements this semantic.
  - Tests from ripes (and adapted riscv-tests) ecall a7/x17 93, a0/x10 0 pass, 1 fail; test number in gp/x3
 * Venus, a JavaScript based simulator, implements
   [environment calls](https://github.com/kvakil/venus/wiki/Environmental-Calls)
   some of the [system calls](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/secondyear/spim/node8.html)
   from the MIPS simulators SPIM and MARS.
 * What does Ripes do?
 * What else in ecall is implemented in spike?
 * In a (newlib) compiled C program clib functions (such as file IO) call
   `__internal_syscall`, which itself (after rotation of registers `a0`-`a7`)
   executes `ecall`. Does this go to the proxy kernel (pk)?

## Memory Layout

The memory layout is probably also environment (OS) dependent.
Here some observations:

 * ISA test cases start at 0x80000000 with a `_start` symbol
 * An assembler program linked with `.start` at 0x8000000 is executed by spike.
   However, spike starts at 0x1000 and executes 5 boostrap instructions.
   Assume those are hardcoded into spike.
 * Compiling a C program (with newlib) has a start address (`_start`) at 0x00010074.
   Assume that the proxy kernel is loaded at 0x8000000 and simply gets the start
  address from the .elf file.
 * Venus follows the MIPS (MARS/SPIM) convention:
   * `.text` at 0x00000000
   * `.data` at 0x10000000
   * sp at 0x7ffffff0
   * heap probably at 0x10008000
 * Hex files of some (old Sodor?) test cases start at 0x200.

## Software Traps

 * Unaligned memory access can be trapped and handled in SW (Berkeley cores do/did this)
   * Same can be done for floating point emulation
